Hi there!

This repository is a starter template for using Flask, Nginx and Docker!

To get the project running we require docker & docker-compose to be installed on your system. If you are running a Mac or Linux based system the provided dockerInstaller.sh can be ran to simplify this.

In the terminal simply type: \
~/bash dockerInstaller.sh

Now we're going to build the containers, this may require you prepend the below command with 'sudo': \
~/docker-compose build 

And finally run the comannd:
~/docker-compose up -d

Now, in your browser you can navigate to 'localhost' and should see the project running!
